        <p class="long-text">Hello! I'm Jack (he/they, 31/07 DD/MM), though you might know me by a few other aliases like 'amnexya', 'shebang', 'andrs', or 'Jack Anders',
           I'm from the North East of the UK, born and raised in Durham but living in Tyne and Wear now.
        </p>
        <p class="long-text">As far as I know, I've always wanted to work with computers at some point, I mean I got my first bit of tech at 5, that being an iPad Mini 1st gen, 
           which believe it or not sparked an interest in software piracy, I always wanted a way to try things before I bought them, and with demo's slowly
           whittling away, I resorted to that.
           On this iPad I was able to get a bit of a headstart with basic lua around the time I was 8 after finding an app called Codea, was fun to mess about
           with back then and pretty much started everything off.
        </p>
        <p class="long-text">Once I got my first laptop (an Acer Aspire ES13, very low powered machine for 2017 standards), pretty much everything else got kickstarted.
           I began messing around with a bit of HTML back then, figuring out how websites were actually made, but the main thing I enjoyed doing was
           virtualising old OS's like XP, 98, 95, etc... Not entirely sure why I had an interest with that but I suppose I did.
           Along with the virtualising OS's came my first introduction to Linux through Ubuntu, I had heard of it in the past and messed around with it
           in a Curry's PC World on an old Dell XPS that shipped with it (back when Linux was still used by OEM's widely).
           A bit after that, I had broke my windows install and thought, you know what, I'll switch to Linux and see what its like, so cue me at 5am in the 
           morning during Summer 2017, installing Ubuntu onto that old laptop.
        </p>
        <p class="long-text">From then until about 2021, it was mostly a dry spell, I'd be switching distros and switching between Linux and Windows every month or so, until 
           I started getting original project ideas. At this point in school I'd been working in Python to make stuff, and I'd learned about Flask, and thus
           started my obsession with making random web-apps every now and again, and believe me they were bad, which is why you see no trace of them on my GitHub.   
        </p>
        <p class="long-text">Anyway lets get into my musician side. About a year earlier, lockdown had just ended and I'd begun making music under the name 'Aryk', mostly just bad 
           electronic stuff, it was never well-mixed, but I'd started improving by 2021-2022, landing a few good remixes and singles, however I was pretty much 
           producing solely progressive house from 2022-2024, so I wanted to switch it all up and start working on something else, which is where I started 
           making breakcore / speedcore, I'd known about them for a while and loved the genre, but never tried making it, the same can be said for UK Hardcore
           and Hardstyle which I work on today.
        </p>
        <p class="long-text">Most of my life through college was more of a blur, it was okay but wasn't the best time of my life, I was most definitely confused about a lot of
           things at that point, including what direction I wanted my life to go. Obviously I ended up figuring all that out at the end, and I'm much happier
           in University now.
        </p>
        <p class="long-text">The one thing about me that has never changed though, is my drive to work on things and build, both in tech and with myself.
           There has never been a point where I've not been working on something, where I've been left with nothing to do, it's where I'm able to find
           enjoyment and fun, similar with this site, it always goes through design changes. This page is just to go over me as a person, and why I do 
           what I do, have fun looking at the rest of the site.
