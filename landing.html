    <p>obligatory router out of shot in this photo</p>
    <p>self-hosting stuff is fun, i have a shitty homelab that somehow keeps a good uptime (apart from power outages which are often), it runs my whole segregated network, some media and storage servers, and other stuff. i plan to open some stuff up to this domain for people to use at some point, i think ill need some better equipment before i do that though.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>for other stuff, i enjoy looking into transportation (light/heavy rail, aviation, etc...), and travelling, either by driving or travelling on a train/plane, its fun. i do want to try urbex at some point but yk. im also diagnosed adhd combined, i <3 dextroamphetamine.</p>
