        <p>So you want to get in touch with me?</p>
        <p>The easiest way for you to do that is to send me an email, or send me a letter through snail mail. Most personal platforms I will likely reject
           a message request from you simply due to those accounts having more irl info about me on.
        </p>
        <p>Most E-mails I'll be able to respond to within 24 hours (usually), it might take me a bit longer sometimes but you'll not be waiting more than
           a few days.
        </p>
        <p>For snail mail, only send letters, I pass letters through a scanning service which cannot take parcels. If you need to send me something larger,
           or you are sending me something you want me to have in-person, e-mail me first and let me know what you're sending and I may send you my address to send it to.
        </p>

        <p>If you'd prefer to talk to me in a more instant-messaging manner, I have an IRC bouncer running on Libera.chat under the nick 'jackeilles'.
           If you send me a private message on there, I'll get notified immediately and should be able to reply as soon as I'm free.
        </p>
        <p>When contacting me, please ensure that you properly make clear why you are contacting me so I know whether to reply or not, I've had far too many
           instances of someone just messaging 'Hi', with no further clarification, so make sure you tell me why you need to talk to me first, ideally on initial
           contact, thanks!
